                Welcome to Sort-it, the team picking assistant app, that every coach needs!
            </p>

            <p>
                To begin, choose the number of players required per team (minimum 3 players per team). Input players names as well as their skill level (default 2). Once required number of players is reached you have two options to sort teams, random or balanced (based on skill).
            </p>

            <p>
                Next you get to customise team information. Input team names (required), select team kit colour and choose which team is playing home/away.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lastly, pre-match information, outputs both teams as separateÂ list. There is also a button to reveal the bookies favourite, which is calculated using skill totals and home advantage.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've also added some alerts to prompt where certain fields are required, just in case you miss something.
